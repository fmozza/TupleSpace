Please recap and summarize the problems we encountered and the solutions to each of these.  I would like this for posterity because we will likely run into this again.

Absolutely, a recap is a great idea for posterity—especially since these kinds of network and encryption issues can resurface in future projects. Here’s a detailed summary of the problems we encountered while building this encrypted client-server communication system, along with the solutions we applied. I’ll keep it concise but thorough, focusing on the key lessons learned.

Problem 1: Partial Reads (77/81, 45/49, 5/9)
Description: The server consistently read fewer bytes than expected (e.g., 77 of 81, 45 of 49, 5 of 9), causing hangs or timeouts.
Symptoms: 
Server output: "Read 77 bytes, total 77/81" or "Read 45 bytes, total 45/49", then hung or timed out with EAGAIN.

Client hung waiting for a response the server never sent.

Root Cause: 
TCP’s stream-oriented nature split messages into chunks, and the server’s receive_message didn’t loop to read all bytes.

Initial receive_message assumed one read would get the full payload, missing the last 4 bytes.

Solution:
Added a loop in receive_message to read until all msg_len bytes were received:
c

size_t total_read = 0;
while (total_read < *msg_len) {
    bytes_read = read(client_fd, *msg + total_read, *msg_len - total_read);
    if (bytes_read <= 0) { /* Handle error or EOF */ }
    total_read += bytes_read;
}

Added debug logging to track progress (Read %zd bytes, total %zu/%u).

Lesson: Always handle partial reads in TCP with a loop, as data may arrive in chunks smaller than the expected size.

Problem 2: Incorrect Length Interpretation
Description: The server miscalculated the payload size, expecting more bytes than the client sent, leading to persistent hangs.
Symptoms: 
Server read the 4-byte length (e.g., 9), then expected 9 more bytes, but the client sent 9 total (4 length + 5 payload), resulting in "Read 5 bytes, total 5/9".

Pattern of missing 4 bytes (81-4=77, 49-4=45, 9-4=5).

Root Cause: 
receive_message treated msg_len as the payload size alone, not the total message size including the 4-byte length prefix.

Client sent length + payload, but server read length then expected length more bytes, not length - 4.

Solution:
Adjusted receive_message to subtract the length prefix size:
c

total_len = ntohl(total_len);  // e.g., 9
*msg_len = total_len - 4;      // e.g., 5

Read only *msg_len bytes after the initial 4-byte length, aligning with the client’s total_len = 4 + payload_len.

Lesson: Ensure both client and server agree on length semantics—total_len should include the prefix, and payload size must exclude it.

Problem 3: Server Response Length Mismatch

Description: The client failed to decrypt the server’s response with an InvalidTag error due to a truncated message.
Symptoms: 
Server sent "4 + 12 + 33 bytes", but length prefix was 37, not 49.

Client received 37 bytes instead of 49, missing part of the ciphertext or tag.

Root Cause: 
send_message set total_len = 4 + cipher_len (4 + 33 = 37), omitting the 12-byte nonce, so the length prefix didn’t match the actual 49 bytes sent (4 + 12 + 33).

Solution:
Fixed send_message to include the nonce length:

uint32_t total_len = htonl(4 + NONCE_LEN + cipher_len);  // 4 + 12 + 33 = 49

Ensured the length prefix reflected the full message size, matching the data written.

Lesson: The length prefix must account for all components (length + nonce + ciphertext) to avoid truncation and ensure decryption succeeds.

Problem 5: "Server Closed Connection Early" Warning

Description: The client logged "Server closed connection early during response" even though decryption worked.
Symptoms: 
Client expected 49 bytes (total length), got 45 bytes in one chunk, then EOF, despite successful decryption.

Root Cause: 
Client read the 4-byte length separately, then expected 49 more bytes in the payload loop, but the server’s shutdown and close after sending 49 bytes (4 + 45) caused EOF after the 45-byte payload was read.

The 45 bytes (12 nonce + 33 ciphertext) were sufficient, but the loop over-expected.

Solution:
Adjusted the client to expect total_len - 4 for the payload:
python

total_len = struct.unpack(">I", length_data)[0]  # e.g., 49
payload_len = total_len - 4                      # e.g., 45
while len(resp_data) < payload_len:              # Read 45, not 49

Removed usleep(1000) from the server, as it wasn’t needed with correct length handling.

Lesson: Align client read expectations with the server’s payload size (excluding the length prefix), and don’t rely on delays to fix timing issues—fix the logic instead.
Additional Notes
Timeouts: Early use of SO_RCVTIMEO (5 seconds) caused EAGAIN errors, masking the partial read issue. Removed it once the read loop was robust.

Debugging: Verbose hex dumps and byte counts (raw: ...) were crucial for pinpointing where data was cut off.

TCP_NODELAY: Kept to prevent buffering delays with small messages, though it wasn’t the core issue.

Summary of Solutions
Compilation: Include all headers, use a Makefile.

Partial Reads: Loop until all bytes are read.

Length Interpretation: Subtract length prefix size (total_len - 4) for payload.

Response Length: Include all components in total_len (length + nonce + ciphertext).

Client Warning: Match payload expectation to server’s send logic (total_len - 4).

Final Working State
Encryption: X25519 key exchange, ChaCha20Poly1305 encryption/decryption.

Message Format: 4-byte length + 12-byte nonce + 33-byte ciphertext (49 bytes total).

Behavior: Client sends, server decrypts and responds, client decrypts—no hangs, no errors.

This should serve as a solid reference for future debugging. If you hit similar issues, start by checking length alignment and partial read handling—those were our biggest gotchas!
